# Comparative genome analysis using sample-specific string detection in accurate long reads

# Summary
- Comparative genome analysis using sample specific strings
- no need for mapping


## Problem Definition
- Targets and a reference (of some sort), interested in identifying substrings of targets that are not in reference
- _More complex forms of genomic variation, e.g., an inversion-duplication, can be seen as combinations of variants and therefore are not further considered here._
- there should exist for each variant at least one substring of T that is not found in R.
- We postulate, and will later experimentally verify, that with long and accurate enough reads virtually all variants can be found in substrings of T that do not appear in R.
