## Methods

### Resolving germline non-reference L1Hs insertions from PacBio data
- PALMER (Pre- mAsking Long reads for Mobile Element inseRtion)
- pre-masks aligned long-read sequences containing known reference L1 sequences obtained from Rep- base (51) and then searches against a ‘hot L1’ sequence (L1.3; GenBank: L19088) (9) to detect non-reference L1Hs insertions within the remaining unmasked sequences in the genome (Figure 1).

### Validation from sequence data from BLAST database and clone data
### Short-read WGS data of NA12878 and L1Hs 5' genomic DNA/L1 junction sequence k-mer analysis
### Polymorphic L1Hs insertion datasets and genomic annota- tion information
### NA12878 cell line preparation and whole genome 3' targeted L1 capture technology for gDNA
### Resolving non-reference L1Hs insertions from whole genome 3′ targeted L1 capture data in bulk experiment
### Single-cell whole genome amplification cell line preparation
### WGS for single-cell whole genome amplification DNA
### Resolving non-reference L1Hs insertions from WGS data in bulk and single-cell WGA experiments


## Results

### Identifying germline non-reference L1Hs insertions from PacBio data in NA12878
### Additional validation for PacBio calls
### Assessment of PALMER calls in existing PacBio sequenced resources
### Novel calls from PacBio data nested in existing reference LINE repeats
### Characterizing germline non-reference L1Hs insertions from PacBio data in NA12878
### L1Hs 5′ genomic DNA/L1 junction sequence k-mer analysis reveals PacBio L1Hs calls are polymorphic in populations of the 1000 Genomes Project
### Whole genome 3′ targeted L1 capture technology in NA12878
### Amplification bias leads to variation of L1Hs calling in WGS among multiple single-cell experiments

## Questions/problems
- Why is pre-masking so important? Won't appear as an insertion surely?
- 5' inverted sequence?
